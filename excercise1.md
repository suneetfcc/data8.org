Dataset: Bay Area Bike Sharing Data https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data

What questions can you answers with this dataset? Questions about which stations are busy and how much duration do people rent bikes for? can you think of other questions this dataset can answer?

1. plot and observe distribution of duration of the rental. (free trips for duration less than half an hour, does it make sense? what's the bin size and why?) 
2. what is the most highly used start station?
3. most highly used start and end stations?
4. contingency table between all possible start and end station pairs
5. shortest trip between start and end stations
6. show stations on a map (station.csv)
7. show different color makers for each city(landmark)
8. come up with a way to visualize the business of a station on the map. (hint: different sized / colored dots on the map?)
